          I believe Web3 is the future for authentication and ownership. Having
          a public verified ledger is amazing. Bitcoin was just the beginning, a
          convenient ownership of a currency with intrinsic value has allowed us
          to not rely on larger organisations to hold our money. We can further
          extend this utility to physical goods, contractual agreements and much
          more. Afraid of forgery, identity theft or any malicious activities
          taken against you? That won't happen with Web3.
